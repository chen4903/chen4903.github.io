Hola, I am Qin Chen, and my nickname is LEVI_104. I major in computer science, and now I am focusing on blockchain security and Distributed Finance (DeFi). I plan on using this space to conduct some technical analysis, and sometimes I write smaller or personal pieces. If you have any fun ideas or things to share, feel free to contact me :)
